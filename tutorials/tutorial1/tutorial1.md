# Tutorial 1 - Create model and run simulations

In this tutorial you will learn how to load a language, create a model and run simulations on the generated attack graph.

## Step by step

Create a directory for the tutorial:

`mkdir mal-tutorial1 && cd mal-tutorial1`

Download tyrLang from github and put tyrLang in the directory:

`git clone https://github.com/mal-lang/tyrLang.git`

Create a python virtual environment in the directory:

`python -m virtualenv .venv`

or

`python -m venv .venv`

Install requirements: 
- `pip install mal-toolbox`
- `pip install mal-simulator`

Create a python file in the directory called `simulate.py` with your text editor of choice.

copy this code into `simulate.py`:

```python

import os

from maltoolbox.language import LanguageGraph
from maltoolbox.model import Model, ModelAsset

from maltoolbox.visualization.graphviz_utils import render_model

def connect_net_to_net(model: Model, net1: ModelAsset, net2: ModelAsset):
    """
    Create a connection rule between net1 and net 2 and return it.
    """
    cr_asset_name = f"ConnectionRule {net1.name} {net2.name}"
    cr_asset = model.add_asset("InternetworkConnectionRule", cr_asset_name)
    net1.add_associated_assets("interNetConnections", [cr_asset])
    net2.add_associated_assets("interNetConnections", [cr_asset])
    return cr_asset


def connect_app_to_net(model: Model, app: ModelAsset, net: ModelAsset):
    """
    Create a connection rule between app and net and return it.
    """
    cr_asset_name = f"ConnectionRule {app.name} {net.name}"
    cr_asset = model.add_asset("ConnectionRule", cr_asset_name)
    app.add_associated_assets("appConnections", [cr_asset])
    net.add_associated_assets("netConnections", [cr_asset])
    return cr_asset


def add_vulnerability_to_app(model: Model, app: ModelAsset):
    """
    Add vulnerability and association from `app` to the vuln.
    Return the vuln.
    """
    asset_name = f"Vulnerability {app.name}"
    vuln_asset = model.add_asset("SoftwareVulnerability", asset_name)
    vuln_asset.add_associated_assets("application", [app])
    return vuln_asset


def add_data_to_app(model: Model, app: ModelAsset):
    """
    Add a data asset and association from `app` to the data.
    reutrn the data asset.
    """
    asset_name = f"Data on {app.name}"
    data_asset = model.add_asset("Data", asset_name)
    data_asset.add_associated_assets("containingApp", [app])
    return data_asset


```

These helper functions are made to work with the MAL language TyrLang, association fieldnames and asset types are specific per language.

Each function creates assets in a model and connects the assets to other assets using associations (associatoin fieldnames to be more exact).

Lets create a model and use the helper methods. Add this to the end of the file:

```python
def create_model(lang_graph: LanguageGraph) -> Model:
    """Create a model with 4 apps"""
    model = Model("my-model", lang_graph)

    # Two networks
    net_a = model.add_asset("Network", "NetworkA")
    net_b = model.add_asset("Network", "NetworkB")
    # Connection between networks
    connect_net_to_net(model, net_a, net_b)

    # Four apps with connections to networks
    app1 = model.add_asset("Application", "App 1")
    connect_app_to_net(model, app1, net_a)
    app2 = model.add_asset("Application", "App 2")
    connect_app_to_net(model, app2, net_a)
    app3 = model.add_asset("Application", "App 3")
    connect_app_to_net(model, app3, net_b)
    app4 = model.add_asset("Application", "App 4")
    connect_app_to_net(model, app4, net_b)

    # Add a vulnerability to app4
    add_vulnerability_to_app(model, app4)

    # Add data to app4
    add_data_to_app(model, app4)

    return model


def main():
    lang_file = "org.mal-lang.tyrLang-0.0.8.mar"
    current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    lang_file_path = os.path.join(current_dir, lang_file)
    tyr_lang = LanguageGraph.load_from_file(lang_file_path)

    # Create our example model
    model = create_model(tyr_lang)

    # Generate an attack graph from the model
    graph = AttackGraph(tyr_lang, model)

    # render_model(model) # Uncomment to render graphviz pdf
    # render_attack_graph(graph) # Uncomment to render graphviz pdf

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Uncomment the line with 'render_model' and run the file with `python simulate.py` to see a [render](my-model.gv.pdf) of the model. This can be helpful to debug generated models.

Then try it with the other line (render_graph) to see a [render](my-attack-graph.gv.pdf) of the attack graph. This will not be very helpful, but gives a feel of the size of the graph.

The attack graph is a representation of the model that folds out all of the attack steps defined in the MAL language. This can be used to run analyzis or simulations.

One option is to work with the attack graph as it is. This requires MAL knowledge about how the graph is structured, what the different types of attack steps mean, etc.

Instead, we will use the `mal-simulator` to run simulations with different agents that can give us some knowledge of the attack graph (which in turn gives us knowledge of the imagined architecture).

To run simulations, add these imports to the top of the file (below the other imports):

```python
from malsim import MalSimulator, run_simulation
from malsim.agents import RandomAgent
```

Now we can create a MalSimulator from the attack graph and run simulations.

Add this to the end of the `main` function:

```python

simulator = MalSimulator(graph)
agents = {}
path = run_simulation(simulator, agents)

```

When we run `python simulate.py` now we will just see "Simulation over after 0 steps.". This is because we don't have any agents. Let us add an attacker agent.

Replace the line `agents = {}` with:

```python
    simulator.register_attacker("MyAttacker", entry_points=["App 1:fullAccess"], goals=["DataOnApp4:read"])
    agents =  [{'name': "MyAttacker", "agent": RandomAgent({})}]
```

This registers an attacker in the simulator, and creates a list of decision agents that can be used to take decisions for the simulator attacker.

When we run `python simulate.py` now, we can see that the simulation runs until the attacker reaches `DataOnApp4:read`.
This tells us that there was a path from `App 1` to `DataOnApp4`.

As we repeat the command, we can see that it reaches it on different iterations, since it is a random agent.

Try this out with different agents in `malsim.agents`.

`run_simulation` will return the path taken by each agent.

To make it more interesting, we probably want to add TTCs to the simulations (time to compromise) and use some form of path finding. TODO.

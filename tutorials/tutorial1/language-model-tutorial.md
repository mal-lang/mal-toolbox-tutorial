# Tutorial 1 - Create a language and a model
In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a simple MAL language and create a model from it.

## Step by step
### Environment set-up
Create a directory for the tutorial and set it as your working directory: `mkdir mal-tutorial1 && cd mal-tutorial1`
Create a Python virtual environment and activate it.
- On Linux-based operating systems:
```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
- On Windows:
```
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```
Install the requirements:
```
pip install mal-toolbox
pip install mal-simulator
```

### MAL language creation
Create a MAL file in the same directory called `my-language.mal`.

Copy this code into `my-language.mal`:

```
#id: "org.mal-lang.my-language"
#version: "1.0.0"

category System {
    asset Computer {
        | connect
            -> access
        | crackPassword [HardAndCertain]
            -> access
        & access
            -> compromise
	    | compromise
            -> folder.accessFolder,
               toComputer.connect,
               toComputer.crackPassword
    }
    asset Folder {
        | accessFolder
            -> stealSecrets
        | stealSecrets
    }
}

associations {
    Computer [fromComputer] * <-- ComputerConnection --> * [toComputer] Computer
    Computer [computer] * <-- ComputerFolderConnection --> * [folder] Folder
}
```

This piece of code defines a simple MALLang. We define a category called System that holds two assets:
- Computer
    - If steps `connect` and `crackPassword` happen, then `access` would be triggered, which at the same time would trigger `compromise`.
    - If `compromise` is activated, we would move to the step `accessFolder` in asset `Folder`.
- Folder
    - If `accessFolder` is given, it would trigger `stealSecrets`.

In the `associations` section we define the relationship assets have. In this case, `Computer` and `Folder` have an N to M relationship, represented by the `*`.

Once we have the MALLang file, we can create a python file to create models from this language.

### Create and compile the model
Create a .py file in the same directory called `tutorial1.py`.

Copy this code into `tutorial1.py`:

```python
import os
from maltoolbox.model import Model
from maltoolbox.language import LanguageGraph


def create_model(lang_graph: LanguageGraph) -> Model:
    """Create a model with 2 computers"""
    model = Model("my-model", lang_graph)

    # Two computers
    comp_a = model.add_asset("Computer", "ComputerA")
    comp_b = model.add_asset("Computer", "ComputerB")

    # Connection between computers
    comp_a.add_associated_assets("toComputer", {comp_b})

    # Two folders
    folder1 = model.add_asset("Folder", "FolderA")
    folder2 = model.add_asset("Folder", "FolderB")

    # Connect the folders to the computers
    comp_b.add_associated_assets("folder", {folder2})
    comp_a.add_associated_assets("folder", {folder1})

    return model
```
In this simple function, we create:
- Two instances of our `Computer` asset (`ComputerA` and `ComputerB`) and our `Folder` asset (`FolderA` and `FolderB`).
- A connection between `ComputerA` and `ComputerB`. The string `"computer2"` comes from the `ComputerConnection` association in the MAL language we created. 
- Two connections between the computer and folder instances. The strings `"folder"` come from the `ComputerFolderConnection` association.

Now we can instantiate the model and compile. Add this to the end of the file:

```python
def main():
    lang_file = "my-language.mal"
    current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    lang_file_path = os.path.join(current_dir, lang_file)
    my_language = LanguageGraph.load_from_file(lang_file_path)

    # Create our example model
    model = create_model(my_language)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Change `lang_file` accordingly. Here we create the model using our own language. To compile it, run the script with `python tutorial1.py`.

### Create an attack graph
To create an attack graph, we use the model and the MALLang. Add this import to the top of the file (below the other imports):

```python
from maltoolbox.attackgraph import AttackGraph
```

Put this line after `model = create_model(tyr_lang)`:

```python
# Generate an attack graph from the model
graph = AttackGraph(my_language, model)
```

The attack graph is a representation of the model that folds out all of the attack steps defined in the MAL language. This can be used to run analysis or simulations.

### Run simulation
To run simulations, add these imports to the top of the file (below the other imports):

```python
from malsim import MalSimulator, run_simulation, AttackerSettings
from malsim.types import AgentSettings
from malsim.policies import RandomAgent
```

Now we can create a MalSimulator from the attack graph `graph` and run simulations.

Add this to the end of the `main` function:

```python
simulator = MalSimulator(graph)
path = run_simulation(simulator, {})
```

When we run `python tutorial1.py` we will just see "Simulation over after 0 steps.". This is because we don't have any agents. Let us add an attacker agent.

To do so, replace the previous code (2 lines) with:

```python
    # Create agent settings
    agent_settings: AgentSettings = {
        "MyAttacker": AttackerSettings(
            "MyAttacker",
            entry_points={"ComputerA:access"},
            goals={"FolderB:stealSecrets"},
            policy=RandomAgent
        )
    }
    simulator = MalSimulator(graph, agent_settings=agent_settings)
    run_simulation(simulator, agent_settings)

    import pprint
    pprint.pprint(simulator.recording)

```

This registers an attacker in the simulator, gives a dict of agents to `run_simulation` which will use the policy set in the AttackerSettings object. We then print the recording of the simulation.
